    "# Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Team Selector\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a comprehensive workflow for Fantasy Premier League (FPL) team selection. It combines:\n",
    "1. Data extraction from the FPL API\n",
    "2. Team optimization using linear programming\n",
    "3. Data storage capabilities for historical analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "- Fetch the latest FPL player, team, and position data\n",
    "- Optimize team selection based on player performance and budget constraints\n",
    "- Customize selection parameters (budget, team preferences, etc.)\n",
    "- Store data to Azure SQL Database (optional)\n",
    "- Display team selection with detailed breakdowns\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use\n",
    "1. Run the notebook from top to bottom\n",
    "2. Review the selected team output\n",
    "3. Adjust parameters in the \"Customization\" section if needed\n",
    "4. (Optional) Configure database settings for data storage\n",
